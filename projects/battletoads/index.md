## 🧠 STAR SUMMARY – Battletoads QA (PC Game Pass)

**Situation:** One-week functional test of Battletoads on Win11, Game Pass build 1.1F.42718, 1920×1080@144Hz, Xbox-layout controllers + keyboard.

**Task:**  Validate core gameplay logic, UI flow, input handling (keyboard/controller focus), audio cues, and basic performance.

**Action:**  Built a test plan, executed the suite daily, captured repro video with Xbox Game Bar/OBS, and logged defects in Jira with clear titles, steps, and evidence.

**Result:**  Surface-level stability is good, but testing revealed several high-impact defects blocking keyboard-only play and local co-op start; findings are prioritised and linked with clips for rapid triage.
