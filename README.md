# 🎮 Kelina Cowell – QA Portfolio

Welcome to my QA portfolio!  

Here you’ll find six fully documented QA projects designed to demonstrate a professional range of testing skills — from functional and exploratory testing to cross-platform and narrative QA.  

These projects were developed as part of my **Game Academy QA Bootcamp**, where I focused on applying industry-standard testing workflows, bug documentation, and player-experience analysis.
